## Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey

Since I was a kid with glow-in-the-dark stars on my ceiling, I've been fascinated with space. I grew up with a mindset that science was cool, and that through observation and experimentation, everything in life was knowable.

I went through a period between late high school and the beginning of college where I lost touch with science. The immediacy of computers and technology gripped me and I had to know them deeper. I don't regret those years, they gave birth to my programming career. But it wasn't until after college into my early 20's, during a time of much self-reevaluation, that I fell back in love with space and science.

It was 2009 when I [first discovered](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc&list=PLWS2mFp_C6rPPIPDdjOqPIM3b-yxxcFmu) Carl Sagan's TV series, [Cosmos: A Personal Voyage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage) (1980). (You can currently watch the entire series online with by searching YouTube. [Start here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClPShKs9Kr0)) The ideas Carl Sagan so knowingly asserted in each episode drew me in. [His poetic words stuck with me](http://johnkary.net/blog/thoughts-on-carl-sagans-pale-blue-dot/) long after I first heard them. Watching the entire 1980 series multiple times since then has instilled in me a framework for how I think about myself and my small and grandly insignificant place in the universe.

When news broke in late 2011 that Cosmos was being reborn with new episodes, I was overwhelmed with excitement. Finally, these inspiring ideas could be brought to a new generation and updated with the latest findings from the 30 years since the original series premiered.

[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Spacetime_Odyssey) (2014) is hosted and narrated by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, and the original writers of the 1980 series, Ann Druyan and Steven Stower, are the writers for the new series. With music by Alan Silvestri, who did the score for the movie "Contact," based on Sagan's novel of the same name, you couldn't ask for more of the original magic that made the original series, short of Carl Sagan himself being involved.

The show and its writing pay tribute to the original by sprinkling well-known quotes or clips of Carl Sagan, and reusing metaphors from the original such as [The Spaceship of the Imagination](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWmbZ1K6ID0), [The Cosmic Calendar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln8UwPd1z20) and the [Evolution in 40 Seconds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZpsVSVRsZk#t=355) animation. The visuals effects are as good as any you'll find in a blockbuster film. Animated segments exploring historic scientific figures are stylish yet original, and take what could be yet another boring historical stance and make it very engaging. Its ultimate goal is to lead you to rethink what you think you know about who you are, where you come from and where you're going.

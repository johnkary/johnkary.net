Severe weather and tornadoes are the best part of living in the midwestern United States. I love the anticipation of a severe thunderstorm or tornado watch being issued for my area and watching the storms develop on radar and passing over my house. Technology helps me follow weather closely to stay informed and prepared.

This week is [Severe Weather Awareness Week](http://www.crh.noaa.gov/top/?n=swaw) in Kansas, which means severe weather season is approaching! Weather can change very quickly in Kansas, sometimes in a matter of minutes, and it's important to have multiple ways to receive timely alerts about changing weather conditions. Here are some of the tools I use to follow severe weather.

## [Storm Prediction Center](http://www.spc.noaa.gov/)

The SPC is part of the National Weather Service (NWS) and specifically forecasts high-impact weather events such as tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, hazardous winter weather and even wildfires. The fun stuff.

Between April and July I check SPC every morning to get an idea of the threat levels in my region. If an event is forecast for my area, the Day Outlook products describe in more detail what forecasters anticipate might happen, what regions might be affected, and how confident they are about different forecast details (region, type of threat, timing, etc.)

SPC forecasts several days in advance about the possibility of severe weather, with their confidence levels increasing as the time of impact draws closer. Convective Outlook is their main product with graph analysis and narratives: maps of the United States with color-coded regions drawn to indicate increasingly stronger probabilities of severe weather impacting a region.

    <span class="caption">SPC Day 2 Categorical Outlook for April 14, 2012, which was the second day of a significant outbreak spanning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_13%E2%80%9316,_2012_tornado_outbreak">April 13-16, 2012</a></span>

Their [Day 1 Outlook](http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html) indicates the severe weather forecast within the next 24 hours, with separate maps indicating regional probabilities for being affected by tornadoes, high winds and hail. Each threat is marked by a polygon, indicating a higher and higher likelihood of an event inside the polygon area.

For example, a 5% tornado polygon means given a random point inside the polygon, there would be a 5% chance of a tornado occurring within a 25 mile radius of that point. On very active days a tornado polygon could be as high as 30% or 40%, indicating high confidence a tornado will occur within a very focused region.

During the peak of severe weather season (mostly April through late June here in Kansas) I pay specific attention to Day 2 and Day 3 outlooks (forecasting tomorrow and the next day, respectively) to see how severe weather might impact us days in advance. Knowing weather events are possible means I plan to pay close attention on that day, and prepared to alter plans as necessary.

## Best Radar App: [RadarScope](http://radarscope.tv/products/)

RadarScope is an incredibly well done, award-winning radar software for OSX ($30), iOS ($10) and Android ($10). It allows you to quickly pick a regional radar and see updated motion radar data every couple minutes.

RadarScope leverages geo-location to plot your current position on the map and orient the view positioning you at the center. It's very easy to move around the map and interface to track incoming weather as it moves through your region. Warning polygons are easily highlighted to clearly show affected areas, and it's easy to summon each warning's text description issued by the National Weather Service.

My favorite features include the ability to switch between many different radar products, like vertical tilts, to see higher into the upper-levels storms as they extend up into the atmosphere; the Velocity products are great for zooming in on a storm cell and looking for strong storm rotation which may indicate a tornado forming; and the Precipitation Depiction product that shows rain/mix/snow lines opposed to the normal Reflectivity data.

I use RadarScope on my Mac when storms are approaching, and on my iPhone when out and about to quickly see severe thunderstorm and tornado warning polygons, then loop the radar to watch how the storm is evolving as it heads towards impact areas. Before heading to or from work I will open RadarScope to see if my commute might be impacted by developing storms. Based on that I may delay leaving or plan a different route to avoid bad weather.

## Text-based and Phone Call Weather Alerts

Most new cell phones have Emergency Alerts enabled at the operating system level, where the cell data provider pushes text alerts based on your current location--more specifically the location of the cell tower(s) currently providing your phone with network coverage.

But these Emergency Alerts don't do as much good if a tornado warning is issued and you're 50 miles from home where your loved ones are. You wouldn't be notified of the warning because your cell tower is not in the warning polygon.

You should sign up for text-based alerts to message you when watches and warnings are issued for areas you care about, like where you live and work. Some services even offer to call your phone (landline or cell phone) with a voice message describing the watch or warning issued. This works great for our parents or grandparents that aren't as tech-savvy or don't have smart phones.

Many news stations, cities or counties provide free notification services. Other third-party services may charge for it. Contact local Emergency Management department or TV and radio outlets to find which services are available in your area.

Where I live in Lawrence, Kansas (Douglas County) has several alert services that I trust:

* [IRIS text alerts and phone calls](http://www.douglas-county.com/depts/em/preparedness/em_iris.aspx) - FREE. Only for residents of Douglas County. Pick which alerts to receive, how to receive them, and supply multiple contact numbers to include other family members.
* [WIBW Text Alerts](http://www.wibw.com/mobile/headlines/84244707.html) - FREE. For residents across NE Kansas. WIBW sends text alerts straight to your phone when a watch or warning is issued for any county in NE KS. Select which counties interest you when signing up.

Local Twitter accounts that broadcast timely weather info for Lawrence, KS and Northeast Kansas:

* [@NWSTopeka](https://twitter.com/NWSTopeka) - Official account for the National Weather Service office in Topeka. Forecast and severe weather possibilities.
* [@dgcoem](https://twitter.com/dgcoem) - Douglas County Emergency Management. First to relay local weather information.
* [@iembot_top](https://twitter.com/iembot_top) - IEMBot Topeka. Real-time warnings and reports.
* [#kswx](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23kswx&f=realtime) and [#ksstorms](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ksstorms&f=realtime) hashtags, where people post live storm accounts and relevant regional info

# TODO: Add screenshot here!

On a less serious note, I inexplicably think the [Doge meme](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge) is hilarious. And obviously I love weather. That's why I've made [DogeWeather.com](http://dogeweather.com) my new homepage.

The site gives the current weather conditions according to location data your browser shares with the site, and puts the Doge dog in different weather scenarios that just look hilarious. Of course it also has the Doge sayings "wow so \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_" and "such \_\_\_\_\_\_\_" and "much \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_" and "very \_\_\_\_\_\_\_" randomly popping up in Comic Sans all over the screen describing the current conditions.

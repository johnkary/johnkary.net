Since January 2015 I've worked in Kansas City, MO as a software developer in the
biomedical research field. Our small internal team builds
software used by our facility's scientists to facilitate parts of their
gene-based research.

Our primary application is a client-side application written in ExtJS
JavaScript framework, which talks to an HTTP API built on top of
PHP + Symfony2 framework and a number of in-house custom components.

I attend and [regularly speak](http://johnkary.net/talks) at a few local
user groups:

* Co-Organizer, [Kansas City PHP User Group][]
* Co-Organizer, [Lawrence Coders][]

### My daily toolset

- PHP (Symfony2, PHPUnit)
- JavaScript (ExtJS)
- git
- PhpStorm
- vim
- Vagrant + Chef
- Atlassian products (JIRA, Stash, Bamboo CI, Confluence)
- MacOS host machine
- Linux servers

### Interested in

- Ruby, Go, Erlang
- Docker
- Learning more functional programming concepts

### Contracting

Before my current position I contracted for 2 years, helping teams
modernize their legacy PHP code bases, work better as a team,
git workflows, setting up continuous integration, teaching automated
testing and mentoring.

### University of Kansas

Before becoming a full-time contractor, I worked at the University of
Kansas (within IT) as the team's Technical Lead Programmer. I pushed the
team and my co-workers to adopt modern development practices. Our team was
the central web development group on campus, responsible for the
public-facing presence [http://www.ku.edu](http://www.ku.edu) and
various custom web applications used by departments all over the
University.

* Fall 2004 - hired as part-time student developer
* January 2007 - hired full-time
* August 2010 - promoted to technical lead
* July 2013 - left to pursue full-time consulting

### RapidHire

Since 2007 I have been the lead PHP application developer for RapidHire: a
truck driver recruitment management software company based in the Denver,
Colorado area.

At RapidHire, I have developed a web application system allowing truck
drivers to input their extensive job application data and digitally sign
their job application and legal documents, all in their browser. The system
generats PDFs of all documents, including digital signature on all application
materials, providing a fully digital job application workflow. This system
allows RapidHire's customers to instantly screen and approve driver applicants
without faxing or mailing legal documents to be signed and returned by the
driver.

We deploy on an IBM AS400/i5 environment using DB2 and Zend Server instead, of
a traditional LAMP stack.

### The Beginning&hellip;

Web development [started][] as a hobby in 1998 on [Chris
Escalante's][] parents' dining room table. Chris and I are still very
close friends and continue to collaborate to this day.

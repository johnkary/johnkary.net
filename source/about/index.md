I am a contract web application developer from Lawrence, Kansas. [Please
be in touch](http://johnkary.net/contact) if you think I can help! I have
lots of experience leading small teams, and love helping developers learn
new things, like how to collaborate effectively with git or migrating a
legacy codebase to a modern web stack.

I have worked mostly in higher education, the trucking industry and research
institutions but am always looking for new interesting fields!

I attend and [speak](http://johnkary.net/talks) at a few local user groups in my area, including
being Co-Organizer of the [Kansas City PHP User Group][], and also help drive
the language-agnostic [Lawrence Coders][] group.

### My favorite tools

- PHP
- Symfony2 framework and components
- git
- JavaScript
- WebKit inspector
- PhpStorm
- vim
- iTerm2
- Vagrant + Chef/Puppet
- MacBook Air

### University of Kansas

Before becoming a contractor, I worked as the Technical Lead/Senior
Programmer for the campus-wide web development team at the [University
of Kansas](http://www.ku.edu).
I started as a part-time student web developer in Fall 2004, was
hired as a full time programmer in January 2007, assumed the technical
lead role in August 2010 and then pursued my own consultancy full-time
in July 2013.

That group is the primarily web development group on campus, responsible
for implementing the University's [public-facing web presence][] and
developing custom web applications for both IT and various departments.
The group is regularly sought for consulting and advice from various
smaller development shops on campus, including hosting and facilitating the
monthly campus-wide KU Web Developers meeting.

### RapidHire

Since 2007 I have been the lead PHP application developer for RapidHire: a
truck driver recruitment management software company based in the Denver,
Colorado area.

At RapidHire, I have developed a web application system allowing truck
drivers to input their extensive job application data and digitally sign
their job application and legal documents, all in their browser. The system
generats PDFs of all documents, including digital signature on all application
materials, providing a fully digital job application workflow. This system
allows RapidHire's customers to instantly screen and approve driver applicants
without faxing or mailing legal documents to be signed and returned by the
driver.

We deploy on an IBM AS400/i5 environment using DB2 and Zend Server instead, of
a traditional LAMP stack.

### The Beginning&hellip;

I [got my start in web development][] as a hobby in 1998 on [Chris
Escalante's][] parents' dining room table. Chris and I are still very
close friends and continue to collaborate to this day.

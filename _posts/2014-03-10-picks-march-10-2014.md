> [Aaron Sumner](http://aaronsumner.com/), a local developer in my community, does a weekly "[picks](http://aaronsumner.com/posts/2014/02/3-picks-hover-harvest-hemingway.html)" post that I find very useful. He inspired me to start a similar recurring installment that I hope will push me to explore more new things, and a way to better share what I find interesting and useful.

This installment of picks is all about being prepared for severe weather and tornadoes through use of technology. Last week was [Severe Weather Awareness Week](http://www.crh.noaa.gov/top/?n=swaw) in Kansas, which means severe weather season is approaching. Weather can change very quickly in Kansas, sometimes in a matter of minutes, and it's important to have multiple ways to receive timely alerts about changing weather conditions. I wanted to share some of the resources and tools I use to keep up on what's happening.

## [Storm Prediction Center](http://www.spc.noaa.gov/)

The SPC, as it's known among weather people, is part of the National Weather Service (NWS) and specifically forecasts high-impact weather events such as tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, hazardous winter weather and even wildfires.

I check SPC every morning to get an idea of the threat levels in my region. If an event is forecasted for my area, I look through the outlook products and read the forecast description to get a better idea of what's going on, when it will happen, and the forecasters' confidence level for timing and type of hazard.

SPC forecasts several days in advance about the possibility of severe weather, with their confidence levels increasing as the time of impact draws closer. Their main product is their Convective Outlook analysis graphs and narratives, which are basically maps of the United States with color-coded regions drawn to indicate increasingly stronger probabilities of severe weather impacting a region.

    <span class="caption">SPC Day 2 Categorical Outlook for April 14, 2012, which was the second day of a significant outbreak spanning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_13%E2%80%9316,_2012_tornado_outbreak">April 13-16, 2012</a></span>
</div>

Their [Day 1 Outlook](http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html) indicates the forecast for severe weather events within the next 24 hours, with separate maps indicating regional probabilities for being affected by tornadoes, high winds and hail. Each threat is marked by a polygon, indicating a higher and higher likelihood of an event inside the polygon area. For example, a 5% tornado polygon would mean that you could pick any random point inside the polygon and given the forecasters best estimate, there would be a 5% chance of a tornado occurring within a 25 mile radius of that point. On very bad days that polygon could be as high as 30% or 40%, when a very focused threat level is in effect for a very small region.

During the peak of severe weather season (mostly April through late June here in Kansas) I will pay specific attention to Day 2 and Day 3 outlooks to see how severe weather might impact us days in advance so I can be prepared and alter plans as necessary.

If you geek out on this stuff too, we should be friends.


## [RadarScope](http://radarscope.tv/products/)

RadarScope is an incredibly well done, award-winning radar software for OSX ($30), iOS ($10) and Android ($10). It allows you to quickly pick a regional radar and see updated motion radar data every couple minutes.

</div>

RadarScope also leverages device geolocation to plot your position on the map and orient the map viewport to position you at the center. It's then very easy to navigate and move around the map to track incoming weather as it moves through your region. Warning polygons are easily highlighted so you can see affected areas, and it's easy to pull up each warning's specific warning text issued by the National Weather Service.

My favorite features include the ability to switch between the many different radar products, such as the different vertical tilts allowing you to see into the upper-levels of a storm as it extends up into the atmosphere; the Velocity products so you can zoom in on a storm cell and look for strong storm rotation like tornadoes; and the Precipitation Depiction product that shows rain/mix/snow lines instead of just the normal Reflectivity data.

I use RadarScope on my Mac when storms are approaching, and on my iPhone when out an about to quickly see severe thunderstorm and tornado warning polygons, then loop the radar to watch how the storm is evolving as it heads towards impact areas. Before heading to or from work I will pop open RadarScope if we have stormy weather in the area see if my commute will be impacted by any possible storms. Based on that I may delay leaving or reroute if needed to avoid bad weather.


## Text-based and Phone Call Weather Alerts

Most new cell phones now have some type of Emergency Alerts enabled at the operating system level, where the cell data provider will push text alerts based on the location of the cell tower(s) your phone is communicating with.

But these Emergency Alerts don't do you much good if you're 50 miles from home and your loved ones are still at home when a tornado warning is issued. You wouldn't be notified of the warning because your cell tower is not in the warning polygon.

You should sign up for text-based alerts for watches and warnings you care about, including where you live and work. Some services will also even call your phone (landline or cell phone) when a watch or warning is issued. This works great for our parents or grandparents that aren't as tech-savvy or don't have smart phones.

Many news stations and some cities or counties provide notification services for free, while others charge for it. You should check within your community to see what services are available.

Where I live in Lawrence (Douglas County), Kansas there are several alert products available that I trust:

* [IRIS text alerts and phone calls](http://www.douglas-county.com/depts/em/preparedness/em_iris.aspx) - FREE. Only for residents of Douglas County. You pick which alerts you want to receive, how you want to receive them, and can supply multiple contact numbers to include your whole family.
* [WIBW Text Alerts](http://www.wibw.com/mobile/headlines/84244707.html) - FREE. For residents across NE Kansas. WIBW will send text alerts to your phone when a watch or warning is issued for any county in NE KS that you choose when signing up.

Local Twitter accounts that put out timely weather info for Lawrence, KS and NE KS:

* [@NWSTopeka](https://twitter.com/NWSTopeka) - Official account of the National Weather Service office in Topeka. Forecast and severe weather possibilities.
* [@dgcoem](https://twitter.com/dgcoem) - Douglas County Emergency Management. First to relay local weather information.
* [@iembot_top](https://twitter.com/iembot_top) - IEMBot Topeka. Real-time warnings and reports.
* [#kswx](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23kswx&f=realtime) and [#ksstorms](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ksstorms&f=realtime) hashtags, where people post live storm accounts and relevant info to the region

## [DogeWeather.com](http://dogeweather.com)

On a less serious note, I inexplicably think the [Doge meme](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge) is hilarious. And obviously I love weather. That's why I've made [DogeWeather.com](http://dogeweather.com) my new homepage.

The site gives the current weather conditions according to location data your browser shares with the site, and puts the Doge dog in different weather scenarios that just look hilarious. Of course it also has the Doge sayings "wow so \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_" and "such \_\_\_\_\_\_\_" and "much \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_" and "very \_\_\_\_\_\_\_" randomly popping up in Comic Sans all over the screen describing the current conditions.
